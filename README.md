# Project Description :
- 1	Hardware components
  *  LCD (2*16)
  *  Keypad (3 * 3) (Note: 4 buttons will be used) 
  *  Temperature sensor (LM35) 
  *  Buzzer

- 2 Software requirements
  - The system starts initially by welcoming the user 
  - Then inform the user about the default temp and ask for desired one 
  - Display range of temperature starts from min 18 and to max 35 C
  - To enter the desired temperature user has access through two buttons button one to increase and button two to decrease above or below the default temperature 
  - Once button three is pressed the desired temperature will be set 
  - If the desired temperature is greater than the default one buzzer will be on until both are equal
  - If button 4 is pressed at any time that will take the user back to set another desired temperature 
  - Button 5 will be used to reset the system to start again
